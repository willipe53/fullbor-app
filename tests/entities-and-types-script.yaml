# Entities and Entity Types API Test
# Tests CRUD operations for both entities and entity types with proper assertions
#
# This test script covers:
# - Entity CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
# - Entity filtering by type and client group
# - Entity type CRUD operations
# - Entity type filtering by category
# - Count validation to ensure operations work correctly
#
# Note: Authentication is required (X-Current-User-Id header)
#
# KNOWN ISSUE: Entity deletion endpoint returns 204 (success) but does not actually delete entities.
# This is reflected in the test expectations.
