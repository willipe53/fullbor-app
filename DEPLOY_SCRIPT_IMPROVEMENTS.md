# Deploy Script Improvements

## Summary of Changes to `scripts/deploy-api-config.py`

### 1. Added Stabilization Delay After OpenAPI Import

**Location:** `_import_openapi_spec()` method (line 259-262)

```python
# Wait for API Gateway to stabilize after import
# This gives AWS time to process the changes before we modify integrations
logger.info("Waiting for API Gateway to stabilize after import...")
time.sleep(3)
```

**Why:** API Gateway needs time to process the OpenAPI spec import before we can reliably add Lambda integrations. This prevents race conditions.

---

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in `_update_lambda_integrations()`

**Location:** Lines 371-494

**Improvements:**

- ✅ Added retry logic (up to 3 attempts) for each integration
- ✅ Track successful vs failed integrations with detailed counts
- ✅ Verify each integration after creation with `get_integration()`
- ✅ Brief pause (0.2s) after each integration to let AWS process
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages showing exactly which endpoints failed
- ✅ Raises exception if any integrations fail (prevents partial deployments)

**Key Features:**

```python
# Track integration attempts
total_updated = 0
total_failed = 0
failed_endpoints = []

# Retry logic for each integration
max_retries = 3
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Create integration
        self.apigateway_client.put_integration(...)

        # Verify it was created correctly
        time.sleep(0.2)
        integration = self.apigateway_client.get_integration(...)

        if integration['type'] == 'AWS_PROXY':
            total_updated += 1
            logger.info(f"✅ Updated {method} {resource_path} → {lambda_function_name}")
            break
    except Exception as e:
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            logger.warning(f"Retry {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}...")
            time.sleep(1)
        else:
            raise
```

---

### 3. Added Integration Verification Method

**Location:** `_verify_all_integrations()` method (lines 496-552)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive check that all API endpoints have proper Lambda integrations **before** attempting deployment.

**Features:**

- Scans all API resources and methods
- Skips OPTIONS methods (they use MOCK integration)
- Verifies each non-OPTIONS method has AWS_PROXY integration
- Reports detailed statistics:
  - Total methods checked
  - Methods with correct integration
  - Missing or incorrect integrations
- Returns `False` if any issues found

**Example Output:**

```
=== Integration Verification Results ===
Total methods (excluding OPTIONS): 44
Methods with AWS_PROXY integration: 44
Missing or incorrect integrations: 0
✅ All integrations verified successfully!
```

---

### 4. Integrated Verification into Deployment Flow

**Location:** `deploy()` method (lines 802-804)

```python
# Update Lambda integrations
self._update_lambda_integrations(api_id)

# Verify all integrations are configured correctly
if not self._verify_all_integrations(api_id):
    raise Exception("Integration verification failed - cannot deploy API")

# Grant Lambda permissions
self._grant_lambda_permissions(api_id)

# Deploy API
self._deploy_api(api_id)
```

**Why:** This prevents the AWS deployment error "No integration defined for method" by catching missing integrations **before** attempting to deploy.

---

## Benefits

1. **🔄 Reliability:** Retry logic handles transient AWS API issues
2. **🔍 Transparency:** Detailed logging shows exactly what's happening
3. **🛡️ Safety:** Verification prevents partial/broken deployments
4. **🐛 Debugging:** Clear error messages identify problem endpoints
5. **⏱️ Timing:** Delays prevent race conditions with AWS processing

---

## Testing the Improvements

To test the enhanced deployment script:

```bash
cd /Users/willipe/github/fullbor-app
python3 scripts/deploy-api-config.py --stage test
```

You should now see:

- "Waiting for API Gateway to stabilize..." after OpenAPI import
- Detailed integration update messages with retry attempts
- "=== Lambda Integration Summary ===" with counts
- "=== Integration Verification Results ===" before deployment
- Clear error messages if anything fails

---

## Configuration Updated

Also updated in this deployment session:

1. **Added `PositionKeeper` to Lambda permissions list** (line 474)
2. **Updated Position Keeper endpoints** in `deploy-lambda.py` validator (line 154)
3. **Removed duplicate `/position-keeper/start` endpoint** from OpenAPI spec
4. **Updated `/position-keeper/start/{mode}`** to accept `incremental` or `full-refresh`

---

## Next Steps

If you encounter deployment issues:

1. Check the detailed error messages in the output
2. Look for "❌ Failed to update" messages to identify problem endpoints
3. Review "Integration Verification Results" for missing integrations
4. Use the manual verification script if needed:

```python
python3 << 'EOF'
import boto3
client = boto3.client('apigateway', region_name='us-east-2')
resources = client.get_resources(restApiId='nkdrongg4e', limit=500)

for resource in resources['items']:
    path = resource.get('path', '')
    if 'resourceMethods' in resource:
        for method in resource['resourceMethods'].keys():
            try:
                client.get_integration(
                    restApiId='nkdrongg4e',
                    resourceId=resource['id'],
                    httpMethod=method
                )
            except:
                print(f"❌ Missing: {method} {path}")
EOF
```
